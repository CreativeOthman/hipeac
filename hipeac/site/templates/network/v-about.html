                    <catchphrase>Since 2004, the HiPEAC (High Performance and Embedded Architecture and Compilation) project has provided a hub for European researchers and industry representatives in computing systems; today, its network, the biggest of its kind in the world, numbers almost 2,000 specialists. It provides a platform for cross-disciplinary research collaboration, brings together representatives from research, industry and policy, and helps prepare the next generation of world-class computer scientists.</catchphrase>
                    <p>HiPEAC organizes four networking events per year: the HiPEAC conference, two Computing Systems Weeks and a summer school. It also produces the biennial HiPEAC Vision, an influential roadmap which informs European technology research policy areas. In addition, the project offers training, support for academic and industry placements, help in finding excellent computing candidates, careers activities and dissemination support.</p>
